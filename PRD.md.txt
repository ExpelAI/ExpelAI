**Key Features:**
- AI Pest Detection (2–3 common pests).
- Risk Level Calculation (Low, Medium, High).
- Trend Analysis (Pest count graphs over time).
- Actionable Recommendations (UV light timing, irrigation adjustments).
- Sensor Integration (Temp, Humidity, Soil Moisture).

**Success Metrics:**
- Detection and risk update in 10–15 seconds.
- Functional trend graphs.
